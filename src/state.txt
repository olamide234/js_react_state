state in web application
how to model state in react application
how to initialize state and set it
using events to trigger state changes
in any sufficient advanced web application, the user interface has to be stateful
state is not always tied to what's happening on the server side
state tracks :
-UI logic 
-business logic i.e the changing state of data e.g in my inbox, messages read or unread, inturn affects how they display

In React, state is an instance attribute on a component. It's always an object
To use state, it should be initialized as soon as the component is created
If component is stateless, one can omit the constructor function
If building a component with state, one need a standard React constructor (class)
